## Introduction
Push_swap is a simple and very effective algorithm project, where you have to sort data.
You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.
What is your goal? Write a C program called push_swap. The program will calculate and display in the standard output the smallest program, created with the Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.
